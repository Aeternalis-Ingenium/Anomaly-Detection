  - [x] Peak Over Threshold with Generalised Pareto Distribution (POT with GPD)
  - [ ] Block Maxima
- [ ] Z-Score
- [ ] Box Plot
- [ ] Median Absolute Deviation (MAD)
- [ ] Isolation Forest
- [ ] Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN)
- [ ] Autoencoders
- [ ] One-Class Support Vector Machine (SVM)
